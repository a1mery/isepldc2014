#+TITLE: What to know?  Prepare for the exam and the evaluation

* Git

You need to be comfortable with a basic Git collaborative workflow
such as the one we used during the lessons.

For example, you need to know

1. how to connect to your github.com account : connect through the website, need to create a SSH key
2. how to "fork" a repository from someone else account: fork on the website which clone the projet on our repository, clone the repository
3. how to clone this repository of yours into your computer : git clone https://...
4. how to commit changes locally on your computer : git add -a (option all), then git commit -m "message"
5. how to push these changes on your github repository : git push
6. how to send a "pull request" to the repository you forked from : pull request from the website 	https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
