Mount

When you plug an extern device to the system, it is located somewhere
in the system, for example : /dev/fd0
and you can't access to its datas.

Mount allows you to define a folder that will contain the content of the extern device.

mount devicePath pathYouWant

mount /dev/fd0 /media/myDevice


If the filesystem type is not a standart, you must precise it.

mount -t type devicePath pathYouWant

mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/myDevice
