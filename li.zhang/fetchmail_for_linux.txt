How to use fetchmail in Linux

To use fetchmail , it is important to finish the configuration. We can do it by commande line or by using "fetchmailconf" with a UI which is easy to use.

The following steps are for commande line.

1.To stop fetchmail while configuring it, run

/etc/init.d/fetchmail stop

2.The file /etc/fetchmailrc should look as follows:

set syslog

set daemon 240

poll pop.gmail.com
  with nodns,
  with protocol POP3
  user "jane.doe@gmail.com" there is jane here,
  with password doeadeer,
  with ssl, sslcertck;

3.Since this file contains your Gmail password, you may wish to give it restrictive read permission:

chmod 600 /etc/fetchmailrc

4.To test your configuration, run fetchmail as below; this should be run as root, since it reads /etc/fetchmailrc.

fetchmail -v -d0 -f /etc/fetchmailrc

Take a look at /var/log/mail.log (e.g., using less /var/log/mail.log) to see that the connection was successful. 

5.Once your configuration is working, you can restart fetchmail with

/etc/init.d/fetchmail start
