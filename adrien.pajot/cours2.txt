USING THE TAR COMMAND TO MANAGE ARCHIVES


COMPRESSING => c

c : create a new archive
v : verbosely list files which are processed.
f : following is the archive file name

example : tar cvf myFile.tar /home/user/randomDir

will put all the folder randomDir in a myFile.tar
!! This will not compress just "compact" into one file the folder !!

If you want to use a compression you will need to add the compression type : 
z for gzip
j for bzip2

EXTRACTING => x

x : extract files from archive
v : verbosely list files which are processed.
f : following is the archive file name

example : tar xvf archive_name.tar

will extract the archive into the current folder
If you want to specify the folder add -C /home/user/yourSpecificFolder

Same as before you will need to specify the compression kind if the archive is compressed

example : tar xvfz myArchive.tar.gz

LISTING

Same as before but instead of x/c you user t

example : tar tvfz myArchive.tar.gz
