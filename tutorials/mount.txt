Mount

When you plug an extern device to the system, it is located somewhere
in the system, for example : /dev/fd0 and you can't access to its
datas.

To know what is the path of the disk, see the tutorial on *fdisk*

Mount allows you to define a folder that will contain the content of
the extern device.  By default, mount will try to guess the filesystem
type of your device

mount devicePath pathYouWant

mount /dev/fd0 /media/myDevice


If the filesystem type is not a standart, you must precise it.

mount -t type devicePath pathYouWant

mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/myDevice


After you mounted your device, if you want to change the directory,
you can use the option --move or -M

mount -M previousDirectory newDirectory

mount --move /media/myDevice /media/newDirForMyDevice


If you want you device to be in read-only, to be safer use the option -r

mount -r devicePath pathYouWant

mount -r /dev/fd0 /media/myDevice


If you want your device to be accessible from multiple path, use the
option -B or --bind

mount -B previousDirectory newDirectory

mount --bind /media/myDevice /media/otherDirForMyDevice
