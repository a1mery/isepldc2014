Create file with cat
cat >foo.txt

Display text file on screen
cat foo.txt

If the file is too large to fit on the computer scree, the text will scroll down at high speed. You will be not able to read. To solve this problem pass the cat command output to the more or less command as follows:
cat bigfile | more
cat bigfile | less

Combine Two Or More Files
cat score.txt names.txt > report.txt
cat report.txt

Number all output Lines
cat -n filename
cat --number filename
