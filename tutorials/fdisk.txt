fdisk

This command lists all the disks in the directory and gives information about them.

The default use is : fdisk -l

this command will separate the local disks from the external disk,
display the type of the partition (fat, ntfs, ...).
Very useful when you try to mount an external disk

the other options are more complicated : 

-u : change the size unit from cylinders to sectors
-s [partition] : the size of the partition in blocks
