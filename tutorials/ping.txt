ping

ping allows you to ping a remote machine, generally to check if the
machine is still alive.

For example, let's use ping on google : 

ping 8.8.8.8

# bzg: is 8.8.8.8 the IP address of google?!

If the command works, you'll have some informations like the time of
response.  With it you can know if there is some latency for example.

If you want to ping with a defined interval, you can use the flag -i : 

Example : 

ping -i 5 8.8.8.8

This will ping the google server every 5s.
